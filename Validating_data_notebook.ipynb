    "Creating modules in Jupyter notebooks is a bit of a pain. If we make changes to the `module.py` file, we have to restart the notebook kernel and import the module again in order to apply those changes. So, we're going to fully develop it, test it in this notebook, and only then, move it to a `data_ingestion.py` file, and import it. \n",

    "To create a module, our code should ideally be encapsulated in functions or classes. How do we choose?\n",

    "Since the process of connecting to a database, and querying some data is relatively straightforward, functions seemed like the best fit. Functions allow us to encapsulate the necessary steps in clear, reusable blocks of code without the overhead of managing class objects. It's like using a **simple tool** for a specific task — pick it up, use it, and put it back without needing to remember anything about the last use.\n",

These modules not only perform various operations on the data but also need to keep track of the data as it goes through these processes. For this, we use **classes** to **create DataFrame objects** as attributes. This approach simplifies data handling since we're passing the object around, which inherently knows its data and the operations it can perform within the class.\n",

    "Secondly, to help us understand how our code is executing we're going to add some logs. While print statements can help us to debug our code, we have to remove them once our code goes into use, one by one. `logging` is a better way to debug our code than print statements because we can add `logging.INFO()` logs to know what our code is doing, and `logging.DEBUG()` statements that have more detail in case we want to debug a specific loop in a bit more in detail. There are also various other tools to use, and we can also silence all logging with a single line of code. If we used print statements, we will have to comment them out one by one. \n",
